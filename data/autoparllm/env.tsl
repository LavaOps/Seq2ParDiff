Parameters:
    #
    # Sets the number of threads to use for parallel regions at the
    # corresponding nested levels. The behavior of the program is
    # implementation defined if any value of the list specified in the
    # OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable leads to a number of threads
    # that is greater than an implementation can support, or if any value
    # is not a positive integer.
    #
    # Default: depends on system (usually number of cores)
    # Values: list of positive intergers
    # Scope: affects #pragma omp parallel
    #
